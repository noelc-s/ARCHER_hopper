## Differences, assumptions, and notes

This section describes differences from the Arduino Ethernet API.

**Note: Please read the function docs in the relevant header files for
more information.**

### Two main differences

There are two main differences that make _QNEthernet_ not a 100% drop-in
replacement for code using the Arduino Ethernet API. These are as follows:

* The `QNEthernet.h` header must be included instead of `Ethernet.h`.
* Everything is inside the `qindesign::network` namespace. In many cases, adding
  the following at the top of your program will obviate the need to qualify any
  object uses or make any other changes:
  ```c++
  using namespace qindesign::network;
  ```

For API additions beyond what the Arduino-style API provides, see:\
[Additional functions and features not in the Arduino API](#additional-functions-and-features-not-in-the-arduino-api)

### Other differences and notes

* UDP support is already included in _QNEthernet.h_. There's no need to also
  include _QNEthernetUDP.h_.
* Ethernet `loop()` is called from `yield()`. The functions that wait for
  timeouts rely on this. This also means that you must use `delay(ms)`,
  `yield()`, or `Ethernet.loop()` when waiting on conditions; waiting without
  calling these functions will cause the TCP/IP stack to never refresh. Note
  that many of the I/O functions call `loop()` so that there's less burden on
  the calling code.
* All but one of the `Ethernet.begin(...)` functions don't block.
  `Ethernet.begin(mac[, timeout])` blocks while waiting for an IP address to
  match the Arduino-style API. It uses a default timeout of 60 seconds. This
  behaviour can be emulated by following a call to `begin()` with a loop that
  checks `Ethernet.localIP()` for a valid IP. See also the new
  `Ethernet.waitForLocalIP(timeout)` or `Ethernet.onAddressChanged(cb)`.
* The Arduino-style `Ethernet.begin(mac, ...)` functions all accept a NULL MAC
  address. If the address is NULL then the internal MAC address will be used.
  As well, if Ethernet fails to start then the MAC address will not be changed.
* `EthernetServer::write(...)` functions always return the write size requested.
  This is because different clients may behave differently.
* The examples at
  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/server.accept/ and
  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/if-ethernetclient/
  directly contradict each other with regard to what `operator bool()` means in
  `EthernetClient`. The first example uses it as "already connected", while the
  second uses it as "available to connect". "Connected" is the chosen concept,
  but different from `connected()` in that it doesn't check for unread data.
* All the Arduino-defined `Ethernet.begin(...)` functions that use the MAC
  address are deprecated.
* `Ethernet.hardwareStatus()`: Returns either
  `EthernetHardwareStatus::EthernetOtherHardware` or
  `EthernetHardwareStatus::EthernetNoHardware`. Note that
  `EthernetOtherHardware` is not defined in the Arduino-style API.
* The following `Ethernet` functions are deprecated and do nothing or return
  some default value:
  * `init(uint8_t sspin)`: Does nothing.
  * `maintain()`: Returns zero.
  * `setRetransmissionCount(uint8_t number)`: Does nothing.
  * `setRetransmissionTimeout(uint16_t milliseconds)`: Does nothing.
* The following `EthernetUDP` functions do nothing:
  * `flush()` because it is ill-defined.
    * Note that this is actually defined in the "Arduino WiFi" and Teensy "UDP"
      APIs and not in the main "Arduino Ethernet" API.\
      See: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/wifi/wifiudp.flush/
* The system starts with the Teensy's actual MAC address. If you want to use
  that address with the deprecated API, you can collect it with
  `Ethernet.macAddress(mac)` and then pass it to one of the deprecated
  `begin(...)` functions.
* All classes and objects are in the `qindesign::network` namespace. This means
  you'll need to fully qualify any types. To avoid this, you could utilize a
  `using` directive:
  ```c++
  using namespace qindesign::network;

  EthernetUDP udp;

  void setup() {
    Ethernet.begin();
  }
  ```
  However, this pollutes the current namespace. An alternative is to choose
  something shorter. For example:
  ```c++
  namespace qn = qindesign::network;

  qn::EthernetUDP udp;

  void setup() {
    qn::Ethernet.begin();
  }
  ```
* Files that configure lwIP for our system:
  * *src/sys_arch.cpp*
  * _src/lwipopts.h_ &larr; use this one for tuning (see _src/lwip/opt.h_ for
    more details)
  * _src/arch/cc.h_
* The main include file, `QNEthernet.h`, in addition to including the
  `Ethernet`, `EthernetFrame`, and `MDNS` instances, also includes the headers
  for `EthernetClient`, `EthernetServer`, and `EthernetUDP`.
* Most of the `Ethernet` functions do nothing or return some form of
  empty/nothing/false unless the system has been initialized.

## Additional functions and features not in the Arduino API

_QNEthernet_ defines functions that don't exist in the Arduino API as it's
currently defined. (See:
[Arduino Ethernet Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/))
This section documents those functions.

Features:
* The `read(buf, len)` functions allow a NULL buffer so that the caller can skip
  data without having to read into a buffer.

### `Ethernet`

The `Ethernet` object is the main Ethernet interface.

* `begin()`: Initializes the library, uses the Teensy's internal MAC address,
  and starts the DHCP client. This returns whether startup was successful. This
  does not wait for an IP address.
* `begin(ipaddr, netmask, gw)`: Initializes the library, uses the Teensy's
  internal MAC address, and uses the given parameters for the network
  configuration. This returns whether startup was successful. The DNS server is
  not set.
* `begin(ipaddr, netmask, gw, dns)`: Initializes the library, uses the Teensy's
  internal MAC address, and uses the given parameters for the network
  configuration. This returns whether startup was successful. The DNS server is
  only set if `dns` is not `INADDR_NONE`; it remains the same if `dns`
  is `INADDR_NONE`.

  Passing `dns`, if not `INADDR_NONE`, ensures that the DNS server IP is set
  before the _address-changed_ callback is called. The alternative approach to
  ensure that the callback has all the information is to call
  `setDNSServerIP(ip)` before the three-parameter version.

* `broadcastIP()`: Returns the broadcast IP address associated with the current
  local IP and subnet mask.
* `dnsServerIP(index)`: Gets a specific DNS server IP address. This returns
  `INADDR_NONE` if the index not in the exclusive range,
  [0, `DNSClient::maxServers()`).
* `end()`: Shuts down the library, including the Ethernet clocks.
* `hostByName()`: Convenience function that tries to resolve a hostname into an
  IP address. This returns whether successful.
* `hostname()`: Gets the DHCP client hostname. An empty string means that no
  hostname is set. The default is "teensy-lwip".
* `interfaceStatus()`: Returns the network interface status, `true` for UP and
  `false` for DOWN.
* `isDHCPActive()`: Returns whether DHCP is active.
* `isDHCPEnabled()`: Returns whether the DHCP client is enabled. This is valid
  whether Ethernet has been started or not.
* `linkState()`: Returns a `bool` indicating the link state. This returns `true`
  if the link is on and `false` otherwise.
* `linkSpeed()`: Returns the link speed in Mbps.
* `linkIsCrossover()`: Returns whether a crossover cable is detected.
* `linkIsFullDuplex()`: Returns whether the link is full duplex (`true`) or half
  duplex (`false`).
* `joinGroup(ip)`: Joins a multicast group.
* `leaveGroup(ip)`: Leaves a multicast group.
* `macAddress()`: Convenience function that returns a pointer to the current
  MAC address.
* `macAddress(mac)`: Fills the 6-byte `mac` array with the current MAC address.
  Note that the equivalent Arduino function is `MACAddress(mac)`.
* `setDHCPEnabled(flag)`: Enables or disables the DHCP client. This may be
  called either before or after Ethernet has started. If DHCP is desired and
  Ethernet is up, but DHCP is not active, an attempt will be made to start the
  DHCP client if the flag is true. This returns whether that attempt was
  successful or if no restart attempt is required.
* `setDNSServerIP(dnsServerIP)`: Sets the DNS server IP address. Note that the
  equivalent Arduino function is `setDnsServerIP(dnsServerIP)`.
* `setDNSServerIP(index, ip)`: Sets a specific DNS server IP address. This does
  nothing if the index is not in the exclusive range,
  [0, `DNSClient::maxServers()`).
* `setHostname(hostname)`: Sets the DHCP client hostname. The empty string will
  set the hostname to nothing. To use something other than the default at system
  start, call this before calling `begin()`.
* `setLinkState(flag)`: Manually sets the link state. This is useful when using
  the loopback feature. Network operations will usually fail unless there's
  a link.
* `setMACAddressAllowed(mac, flag)`: Allows or disallows Ethernet frames
  addressed to the specified MAC address. This is useful when processing raw
  Ethernet frames.
* `waitForLink(timeout)`: Waits for the specified timeout (milliseconds) for
  a link to be detected. This is useful when setting a static IP and making
  connections as a client. Returns whether a link was detected within the
  given timeout.
* `waitForLocalIP(timeout)`: Waits for the specified timeout (milliseconds) for
  the system to have a local IP address. This is useful when waiting for a
  DHCP-assigned address. Returns whether the system obtained an address within
  the given timeout. Note that this also works for a static-assigned address.
* `operator bool()`: Tests if Ethernet is initialized.
* Callback functions: Note that callbacks should be registered before any other
  Ethernet functions are called. This ensures that all events are captured. This
  includes `Ethernet.begin(...)`.
  * `onLinkState(cb)`: The callback is called when the link changes state, for
    example when the Ethernet cable is unplugged.
  * `onAddressChanged(cb)`: The callback is called when any IP settings have
    changed. This might be called before the link or network interface is up if
    a static IP is set.
  * `onInterfaceStatus(cb)`: The callback is called when the network interface
    status changes. It is called _after_ the interface is up but _before_ the
    interface goes down.
* `static constexpr bool isPromiscuousMode()`: Returns whether promiscuous mode
  is enabled.
* `static constexpr int maxMulticastGroups()`: Returns the maximum number of
  available multicast groups, not including the "all systems" group.
* `static constexpr size_t mtu()`: Returns the MTU.

### `EthernetClient`

* `abort()`: Aborts a connection without going through the TCP close process.
* `close()`: Closes a connection, but without waiting. It's similar to `stop()`.
* `closeOutput()`: Shuts down the transmit side of the socket. This is a
  half-close operation.
* `connectNoWait(ip, port)`: Similar to `connect(ip, port)`, but it doesn't
  wait for a connection.
* `connectNoWait(host, port)`: Similar to `connect(host, port)`, but it doesn't
  wait for a connection. Note that the DNS lookup will still wait.
* `connectionId()`: Returns an ID for the connection to which the client refers.
  It will return non-zero if connected and zero if not connected. Note that it's
  possible for new connections to reuse previously-used IDs.
* `connectionTimeout()`: Returns the current timeout value.
* `localIP()`: Returns the local IP of the network interface used for the
  client. Currently, This returns the same value as `Ethernet.localIP()`.
* `status()`: Returns the current TCP connection state. This returns one of
  lwIP's `tcp_state` enum values. To use with _altcp_, define the
  `LWIP_DEBUG` macro.
* `writeFully(b)`: Writes a single byte.
* `writeFully(s)`: Writes a string (`const char *`).
* `writeFully(s, size)`: Writes characters (`const char *`).
* `writeFully(buf, size)`: Writes a data buffer (`const uint8_t *`).
* `static constexpr int maxSockets()`: Returns the maximum number of
  TCP connections.

#### TCP socket options

 * `setNoDelay(flag)`: Sets or clears the TCP_NODELAY flag in order to disable
   or enable Nagle's algorithm, respectively. This must be changed for each
   new connection.
 * `isNoDelay()`: Returns whether the TCP_NODELAY flag is set for the current
   connection. Returns `false` if not connected.

### `EthernetServer`

* `begin(port)`: Starts the server on the given port, first disconnecting any
  existing server if it was listening on a different port. This returns whether
  the server was successfully started.
* `beginWithReuse()`: Similar to `begin()`, but also sets the SO_REUSEADDR
  socket option. This returns whether the server was successfully started.
* `beginWithReuse(port)`: Similar to `begin(port)`, but also sets the
  SO_REUSEADDR socket option. This returns whether the server was
  successfully started.
* `end()`: Shuts down the server.
* `port()`: Returns the server's port, a signed 32-bit value, where -1 means the
  port is not set and a non-negative value is a 16-bit quantity.
* `static constexpr int maxListeners()`: Returns the maximum number of
  TCP listeners.
* `EthernetServer()`: Creates a placeholder server without a port. This form is
  useful when you don't know the port in advance.

All the `begin` functions call `end()` first only if the server is currently
listening and the port or _reuse_ options have changed.

### `EthernetUDP`

* `beginWithReuse(localPort)`: Similar to `begin(localPort)`, but also sets the
  SO_REUSEADDR socket option.
* `beginMulticastWithReuse(ip, localPort)`: Similar to
  `beginMulticast(ip, localPort)`, but also sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option.
* `data()`: Returns a pointer to the received packet data.
* `localPort()`: Returns the port to which the socket is bound, or zero if it is
  not bound.
* `receiveQueueSize()`: Returns the current receive queue size.
* `receivedTimestamp()`: Returns the approximate packet arrival time, measured
  with `millis()`. This is useful in the case where packets have been queued and
  the caller needs the approximate arrival time. Packets are timestamped when
  the UDP receive callback is called.
* `send(host, port, data, len)`: Sends a packet without having to use
  `beginPacket()`, `write()`, and `endPacket()`. It causes less overhead. The
  host can be either an IP address or a hostname.
* `setReceiveQueueSize(size)`: Changes the receive queue size. The minimum
  possible value is 1 and the default is 1. If a value of zero is used, it will
  default to 1. If the new size is smaller than the number of items in the queue
  then all the oldest packets will get dropped.
* `size()`: Returns the total size of the received packet data.
* `operator bool()`: Tests if the socket is listening.
* `static constexpr int maxSockets()`: Returns the maximum number of
  UDP sockets.
* `EthernetUDP(queueSize)`: Creates a new UDP socket having the specified packet
  queue size. The minimum possible value is 1 and the default is 1. If a value
  of zero is used, it will default to 1.

All the `begin` functions call `stop()` first only if the socket is currently
listening and the local port or _reuse_ options have changed.

#### `parsePacket()` return values

The `EthernetUDP::parsePacket()` function in _QNEthernet_ is able to detect
zero-length UDP packets. This means that a zero return value indicates a
valid packet.

Many Arduino examples do the following to test whether there's packet data:

```c++
int packetSize = udp.parsePacket();
if (packetSize) {  // <-- THIS IS NOT CORRECT
  // ...do something...
}
```

This is not correct because negative values mean that there's no packet
available, and negative values are implicitly converted to a Boolean _true_.
Instead, the code should look like this:

```c++
int packetSize = udp.parsePacket();
if (packetSize >= non_negative_value) {  // non_negative_value >= 0
  // ...do something...
}
```

Note that `if (packetSize > 0)` would also be correct, or even something like
`if (packetSize >= 4)`, just as long as the `if (packetSize)` form is not used.

### `EthernetFrame`

The `EthernetFrame` object adds the ability to send and receive raw Ethernet
frames. It provides an API that is similar in feel to `EthernetUDP`. Because,
like `EthernetUDP`, it derives from `Stream`, the `Stream` API can be used to
read from a frame and the `Print` API can be used to write to the frame.

* `beginFrame()`: Starts a new frame. New data can be added using the
  `Print` API. This is similar to `EthernetUDP::beginPacket()`.
* `beginFrame(dstAddr, srcAddr, typeOrLen)`: Starts a new frame and writes the
  given addresses and EtherType/length.
* `beginVLANFrame(dstAddr, srcAddr, vlanInfo, typeOrLen)`: Starts a new
  VLAN-tagged frame and writes the given addresses, VLAN info, and
  EtherType/length.
* `data()`: Returns a pointer to the received frame data.
* `endFrame()`: Sends the frame. This returns whether the send was successful. A
  frame must have been started, its data length must be in the range 14-1514 for
  non-VLAN frames or 18-1518 for VLAN frames, and Ethernet must have been
  initialized. This is similar to `EthernetUDP::endPacket()`.
* `parseFrame()`: Checks if a new frame is available. This is similar
  to `EthernetUDP::parseFrame()`.
* `receiveQueueSize()`: Returns the current receive queue size.
* `receivedTimestamp()`: Returns the approximate frame arrival time, measured
  with `millis()`. This is useful in the case where frames have been queued and
  the caller needs the approximate arrival time. Frames are timestamped when
  the unknown ethernet protocol receive callback is called.
* `send(frame, len)`: Sends a raw Ethernet frame without the overhead of
  `beginFrame()`/`write()`/`endFrame()`. See the description of `endFrame()` for
  size limits. This is similar to `EthernetUDP::send(data, len)`.
* `setReceiveQueueSize(size)`: Sets the receive queue size. The minimum possible
  value is 1 and the default is 1. If a value of zero is used, it will default
  to 1. If the new size is smaller than the number of items in the queue then
  all the oldest frames will get dropped.
* `size()`: Returns the total size of the received frame data.
* `static constexpr int maxFrameLen()`: Returns the maximum frame length
  including the 4-byte FCS. Subtract 4 to get the maximum length that can be
  sent or received using this API. Note that this size includes VLAN frames,
  which are 4 bytes larger.
* `static constexpr int minFrameLen()`: Returns the minimum frame length
  including the 4-byte FCS. Subtract 4 to get the minimum length that can be
  sent or received using this API. Note that padding does not need to be managed
  by the caller, meaning frames smaller than this size are allowed; the system
  will insert padding as needed.

### `MDNS`

The `MDNS` object provides an mDNS API.

* `begin(hostname)`: Starts the mDNS responder and uses the given hostname as
  the name. This first calls `end()` only if the responder is currently running
  and the hostname is different.
* `end()`: Stops the mDNS responder.
* `addService(type, protocol, port)`: Adds a service. The protocol will be set
  to `"_udp"` for anything other than `"_tcp"`. The strings should have a `"_"`
  prefix. Uses the hostname as the service name.
* `addService(type, protocol, port, getTXTFunc)`: Adds a service and associated
  TXT records.
* `hostname()`: Returns the hostname if the responder is running and an empty
  string otherwise.
* `removeService(type, protocol, port)`: Removes a service.
* `restart()`: Restarts the responder, for use when the cable has been
  disconnected for a while and then reconnected. This isn't normally needed
  because the responder already watches for link reconnect.
* `operator bool()`: Tests if the mDNS responder is operating.
* `static constexpr int maxServices()`: Returns the maximum number of
  supported services.

### `DNSClient`

The `DNSClient` class provides an interface to the DNS client.

* `setServer(index, ip)`: Sets a DNS server address.
* `getServer(index)`: Gets a DNS server address.
* `getHostByName(hostname, callback, timeout)`: Looks up a host by name and
  calls the callback when there's a result. The callback is not called once the
  timeout has been reached. The timeout is ignored if it's set to zero.
* `getHostByName(hostname, ip, timeout)`: Looks up a host by name.
* `static constexpr int maxServers()`: Returns the maximum number of
  DNS servers.

### Print utilities

The `util/PrintUtils.h` file declares some useful output functions. Note that
this file is included when `QNEthernet.h` is included; there's no need to
include it separately.

The functions are in the `qindesign::network::util` namespace, so if you've
already added `using namespace qindesign::network;` to your code, they can be
called with `util::writeMagic()` syntax. Otherwise, they need to be fully
qualified: `qindesign::network::util::writeMagic()`.

1. `writeFully(Print &, buf, size, breakf = nullptr)`: Attempts to completely
   write bytes to the given `Print` object; the optional `breakf` function is
   used as the stopping condition. It returns the number of bytes actually
   written. The return value will be less than the requested size only if
   `breakf` returned `true` before all bytes were written. Note that a NULL
   `breakf` function is assumed to return `false`.

   For example, the `EthernetClient::writeFully(...)` functions use this and
   pass the "am I disconnected" condition as the `breakf` function.

2. `writeMagic(Print &, mac, breakf = nullptr)`: Writes the payload for a
   [Magic packet](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN#Magic_packet) to
   the given `Print` object. This uses `writeFully(...)` under the covers and
   passes along the `breakf` function as the stopping condition.

There is also a `Print` decorator for `stdio` output files, `util::StdioPrint`
(assuming the `qindesign::network` namespace is in scope). It provides a `Print`
interface so that it is easy to print `Printable` objects to `stdout` or
`stderr` without having to worry about buffering and the need to flush any
output before printing a `Printable` directly to, say, `Serial`.

### `IPAddress` operators

The core library version of `IPAddress` is missing `==` and `!=` operators that
can compare `const IPAddress` values. Provided in this library are these two
operators. They are declared as follows in the usual namespace:

1. `bool operator==(const IPAddress &a, const IPAddress &b);`
2. `bool operator!=(const IPAddress &a, const IPAddress &b);`

### `operator bool()` and `explicit`

All the `operator bool()` functions in the API are marked as `explicit`. This
means that you might get compiler errors in some circumstances when trying to
use a Boolean-convertible object.

You can use the object as a Boolean expression. For example in an `if` statement
or ternary conditional.

You can't return the object as a `bool` from a function. For example, the
following code should give a compiler error:

```c++
EthernetClient client_;

bool isConnected() {
  return client_;
}
```

Instead, use the following code; it fixes the problem:

```c++
EthernetClient client_;

bool isConnected() {
  return client_ ? true : false;
  // Or this:
  // if (client_) {
  //   return true;
  // } else {
  //   return false;
  // }
}
```

This will also work:

```c++
bool isConnected() {
  return static_cast<bool>(client_);
}
```

## How to run

This library works with both PlatformIO and Arduino. To use it with Arduino,
here are a few steps to follow:

1. Add `#include <QNEthernet.h>`. Note that this include already includes the
   header for `EthernetUDP`. Some external examples also include `SPI.h`. This
   is not needed unless you're actually using SPI in your program.
2. Below that, add: `using namespace qindesign::network;`
3. You likely don't want or need to set/choose your own MAC address, so just
   call `Ethernet.begin()` with no arguments to use DHCP, and the three- or
   four-argument version (IP, subnet mask, gateway[, DNS]) to set your own
   address. If you really want to set your own MAC address, see
   `setMACAddress(mac)` or one of the deprecated `begin(...)` functions that
   takes a MAC address parameter.
4. There is an `Ethernet.waitForLocalIP(timeout)` convenience function that can
   be used to wait for DHCP to supply an address because `Ethernet.begin()`
   doesn't wait. Try 15 seconds (15,000 ms) and see if that works for you.

   Alternatively, you can use [listeners](#how-to-use-listeners) to watch for
   address, link, and network interface activity changes. This obviates the need
   for waiting and is the preferred approach.

5. `Ethernet.hardwareStatus()` can detect both the Ethernet and no-Ethernet
   versions of the hardware.
6. Most other things should be the same.

Please see the examples for more things you can do with the API, including but
not limited to:
* Using listeners to watch for network changes,
* Monitoring and sending raw Ethernet frames, and
* Setting up an mDNS service.

### Concurrent use is not supported

Concurrent use of _QNEthernet_ is not currently supported. This includes ISR
approaches and multi-threading approaches.

First, the underlying lwIP stack must be configured and used a certain way in
order to provide concurrent support. _QNEthernet_ does not configure lwIP for
this. Second, the _QNEthernet_ API, the layer on top of lwIP, isn't designed for
concurrent use.

## How to write data to connections

I'll start with these statements:
1. **Don't use the <code>print<em>X</em>(...)</code> functions when writing data
   to connections.**
2. **Always check the `write(...)` and <code>print<em>X</em>(...)</code> return
   values, retrying if necessary.**
3. Data isn't necessarily sent immediately.

The `write(...)` and <code>print<em>X</em>(...)</code> functions in the `Print`
API all return the number of bytes actually written. This means that you _must
always check the return value, retrying any missing bytes_ if you want all your
data to get sent.

For example, the following code won't necessarily send all 250&times;102 bytes.
Buffers might get full. There might be retries. Etcetera.

```c++
void sendTestData(EthernetClient& client) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
    // 102-byte string (println appends CRLF)
    client.println("1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890"
                   "1234567890");
  }
}
```

The following modification will print a message every time the number of bytes
actually written does not match the number of bytes sent to the function. You
might find that the message prints one or more times.

```c++
void sendTestData(EthernetClient& client) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
    // 102-byte string (println appends CRLF)
    size_t written = client.println("1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890"
                                    "1234567890");
    if (written != 102) {
      // This is not an error!
      Serial.println("Didn't write fully");
    }
  }
}
```

The solution is to utilize the raw `write(...)` functions and retry any bytes
that aren't sent. Let's create a `writeFully(...)` function and use that to send
the data:

```c++
// Keep writing until all the bytes are sent or the connection
// is closed.
void writeFully(EthernetClient &client, const char *data, int len) {
  // Don't use client.connected() as the "connected" check because
  // that will return true if there's data available, and this loop
  // does not check for data available or remove it if it's there.
  while (len > 0 && client) {
    size_t written = client.write(data, len);
    len -= written;
    data += written;
  }
}

void sendTestData(EthernetClient& client) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
    // 102-byte string
    size_t written = writeFully(client, "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "1234567890"
                                        "\r\n");
  }
}
```

_Note that the library implements `writeFully(...)`; you don't have to roll
your own._

Rewriting this to use the library function:

```c++
void sendTestData(EthernetClient& client) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
    // 102-byte string
    size_t written = client.writeFully("1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "1234567890"
                                       "\r\n");
  }
}
```

Let's go back to our original statement about not using the
<code>print<em>X</em>(...)</code> functions. Their implementation is opaque and
they sometimes make assumptions that the data will be "written fully". For
example, Teensyduino's current `print(const String &)` implementation attempts
to send all the bytes and returns the number of bytes sent, but it doesn't tell
you _which_ bytes were sent. For the string `"12345"`, `print(s)` might send
`"12"`, fail to send `"3"`, and successfully send `"45"`, returning the value 4.

Similarly, we have no idea what `print(const Printable &obj)` does because the
`Printable` implementation passed to it is beyond our control. For example,
Teensyduino's `IPAddress::printTo(Print &)` implementation prints the address
without checking the return value of the `print(...)` calls.

Also, most examples I've seen that use any of the
<code>print<em>X</em>(...)</code> functions never check the return values.
Common practice seems to stem from this style of usage. Network applications
work a little differently, and there's no guarantee all the data gets sent.

The `write(...)` functions don't have this problem (unless, of course, there's a
faulty implementation). They attempt to send bytes and return the number of
bytes actually sent.

In summary, my ***strong*** suggestion is to use the `write(...)` functions when
sending network data, checking the return values and acting on them. Or you can
use the library's `writeFully(...)` functions.

See the discussion at:
https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/68389-NativeEthernet-stalling-with-dropped-packets

### `writeFully()` with more break conditions

By default, the `EthernetClient` versions of `writeFully()` wait until the
connection is closed. However, TCP connections can sometimes persist for a long
time after a cable/link disconnect, and a user might wish to only wait so long
for a connection to return. This can be solved by adding additional checks to
the stopping condition function (the `breakf` parameter).

For example, to break on connection close or link down:

```c++
size_t writeFully(EthernetClient &c, const uint8_t *buf, size_t size) {
  return qindesign::network::util::writeFully(c, buf, size, [&c]() {
    return !static_cast<bool>(c) || !Ethernet.linkState();
  });
}
```

To break on connection close or timeout:

```c++
size_t writeFully(EthernetClient &c, const uint8_t *buf, size_t size,
                  uint32_t timeout) {
  uint32_t startT = millis();
  return qindesign::network::util::writeFully(
      c, buf, size, [&c, startT, timeout]() {
        return !static_cast<bool>(c) || (millis() - startT) >= timeout;
      });
}
```

* [Print utilities](#print-utilities)

### Write immediacy

Data isn't necessarily completely sent across the wire after `write(...)` or
`writeFully(...)` calls. Instead, data is merely enqueued until the internal
buffer is full or a timer expires. Now, if the data to send is larger than the
internal TCP buffer then data will be sent and the extra data will be enqueued.
In other words, data is only sent when either the buffer is full or an internal
timer has expired.

To send any buffered data, call `flush()`.

To quote lwIP's `tcp_write()` docs:
> Write data for sending (but does not send it immediately).
>
> It waits in the expectation of more data being sent soon (as
> it can send them more efficiently by combining them together).
> To prompt the system to send data now, call tcp_output() after
> calling tcp_write().

`flush()` is what always calls `tcp_output()` internally. The `write(...)` and
`writeFully(...)` functions only call this when the buffer is full. The
suggestion is to call `flush()` when done sending a "packet" of data, for some
definition of "packet" specific to your application. For example, after sending
a web page to a client or after a chunk of data is ready for the server
to process.

## A note on the examples

The examples aren't meant to be simple. They're meant to be functional. There
are plenty of Arduino-style Ethernet library examples out there. This library
does not aim to be just like the others, it aims to provide some more powerful
tools to enable more powerful programs. The Teensy 4.1 is a serious device; it
demands serious examples.

An attempt was made to use a more robust programming style and modern C++ tools.
For those not as experienced with C++ or larger projects, these may have a
steeper learning curve. Hopefully this brings up lots of questions and an
exposure to new concepts. For example, state machines, lambdas, callbacks,
data structures, vector::emplace_back, and std::move.

For those that do have more C++ and larger project experience, I invite you to
improve or add to the examples so that the set of examples here becomes what
you've always hoped Teensy library examples could be.

## A survey of how connections (aka `EthernetClient`) work

Hopefully this section disambiguates some details about what each function does:
1. `connected()`: Returns whether connected OR data is still available
   (or both).
2. `operator bool()`: Returns whether connected (at least in _QNEthernet_).
3. `available()`: Returns the amount of data available, whether the connection
   is closed or not.
4. `read(...)`: Reads data if there's data available, whether the connection is
   closed or not.

Connections will be closed automatically if the client shuts down a connection,
and _QNEthernet_ will properly handle the state such that the API behaves as
expected. In addition, if a client closes a connection, any buffered data will
still be available via the client API. If it were up to me, I'd have swapped the
meaning of `operator bool()` and `connected()`, but see the above list as
a guide.

Some options:

1. Keep checking `connected()` (or `operator bool()`) and
   `available()`/`read(...)` to keep reading data. The data will run out when
   the connection is closed and after all the buffers are empty. The calls to
   `connected()` (or `operator bool()`) will indicate connection status (plus
   data available in the case of `connected()` or just connection state in the
   case of `operator bool()`).
2. Same as the above, but without one of the two connection-status calls
   (`connected()` or `operator bool()`). The data will just run out after
   connection-closed and after the buffers are empty.

### Connections and link/interface detection

A link and active network interface must be present before a connection can be
made. Either call `Ethernet.waitForLink(timeout)` or check the link state or
network interface status before attempting to connect. Which approach you use
will depend on how your code is structured or intended to be used.

Be aware when using a listener approach to start or stop services that it's
possible, when setting a static IP, for the _address-changed_ callback to be
called before the link or network interface is up.

Note that this section also applies to the DNS client.

### `connect()` behaviour and its return values

Firstly, `connect()` blocks. See the [next section](#connectnowait-doesnt-wait)
for a non-blocking way to connect.

The Arduino API,
[here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/client.connect/),
defines a set of possible return values for this function. Note that the example
on that page is not correct (at the time of this writing) because it assumes
that only a return value of '1' will evaluate to `true`. The C++ spec,
[here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Boolean_conversions),
however, says that all non-zero numeric values will be converted to `true`. The
example, therefore, assumes that a successful connection has been made even if
an error code was returned.

Currently, _QNEthernet's_ implementation of this function will return one of the
following values:

| Value | Meaning                                                               | Arduino Name   |
| ----: | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
|     1 | Success                                                               | SUCCESS        |
|     0 | Can't create connection (eg. no more sockets, network isn't up, etc.) | _None_         |
|    -1 | Connection timeout                                                    | TIMED_OUT      |
|    -2 | DNS lookup failed for the given name                                  | INVALID_SERVER |

### Non-blocking connection functions, `connectNoWait()`

The `connectNoWait()` functions implement non-blocking TCP connections. These
functions behave similarly to `connect()`, however they do not wait for the
connection to be established.

To check for connection establishment, simply call either `connected()` or the
Boolean operator. If a connection can't be established then `close()` must be
called on the object.

Note that DNS lookups for hostnames will still wait.

### Getting the TCP state

TCP connections can be in one of
[several states](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9293#name-state-machine-overview).
Knowing a connection's underlying TCP state can be useful, for example, to avoid
waiting for a timeout via reading data.

This state can be retrieved using an `EthernetClient`'s `status()` function.
Note that, to avoid modiyfing the lwIP code too much, the `LWIP_DEBUG` macro
must be defined when using this function with _altcp_. If not using it with
_altcp_, there's no such concern.

The states, as defined by lwIP's `tcp_state` enum:
1. CLOSED
2. LISTEN
3. SYN_SENT
4. SYN_RCVD
5. ESTABLISHED
6. FIN_WAIT_1
7. FIN_WAIT_2
8. CLOSE_WAIT
9. CLOSING
10. LAST_ACK
11. TIME_WAIT

This enum isn't a C++ "enum class", so its values can be used directly. The
definition is already included by _QNEthernetClient.h_, which is, in turn,
included by _QNEthernet.h_.

## How to use multicast

There are a few ways in the API to utilize multicast to send or receive packets.
For reception, you must join a multicast group.

The first is by using the `EthernetUDP::beginMulticast(ip, port)` function. This
both binds to a specific port, for only receiving traffic on that port, and
joins the specified group address. It's similar to
`EthernetUDP::begin(localPort)` in that the socket will "own" the port.

Since only one socket at a time can be bound to a specific port, you will need
to use the same socket if you want to receive traffic sent to multiple groups on
the same port. You can accomplish this by either calling
`beginMulticast(ip, port)` multiple times, or by using `begin(localPort)` once,
and then calling `Ethernet.joinGroup(ip)` for each group you want to join.

To send multicast traffic, simply send to the appropriate IP address. There's no
need to join a group.

The lwIP stack keeps track of a group "use count". This means:
1. That `joinGroup(ip)` can be called multiple times, it just needs to be paired
   with a matching number of calls to `leaveGroup(ip)`. Each call increments an
   internal count.
2. Each call to `leaveGroup(ip)` decrements a count, and when that count reaches
   zero, the stack actually leaves the group.

## How to use listeners

Instead of waiting for certain states at system start, for example _link-up_ or
_address-changed_, it's possible to watch for state changes using listeners, and
then act on those state changes. This will make your application more robust and
responsive to state changes during program operation.

The relevant functions are (see the [`Ethernet`](#ethernet) section for further
descriptions):
1. `Ethernet.onLinkState(cb)`
2. `Ethernet.onAddressChanged(cb)`
3. `Ethernet.onInterfaceStatus(cb)`

_Link-state_ events occur when an Ethernet link is detected or lost.

_Address-changed_ events occur when the IP address changes, but its effects are
a little more subtle. When setting an address via DHCP, the link and network
interface must already be up in order to receive the information. However, when
setting a static IP address, the event may occur before the link or network
interface is up. This means that if a connection or DNS lookup is attempted when
it is detected that the address is valid, the attempt will fail.

_Interface-status_ events happen when the network interface comes up or goes
down. No network operations can happen before the network interface is up. For
example, when setting a static IP address, the _address-changed_ event may occur
before the network interface has come up. This means that, for example, any
connection attempts or DNS lookup attempts will fail.

It is suggested, therefore, that when taking an action based on an
_address-changed_ event, the link state and network interface status are checked
in addition.

Servers, on the other hand, can be brought up even when there's no link or
active network interface.

In summary, no network operations can be done before all three of _link-up_,
_address_changed-to-valid_, and _interface-up_ occur.

Last, no network tasks should be performed inside the listeners. Instead, set a
flag and then process that flag somewhere in the main loop.

See: [Connections and link/interface detection](#connections-and-linkinterface-detection)

## How to change the number of sockets

lwIP preallocates almost everything. This means that the number of sockets (UDP,
TCP, etc.) the stack can handle is set at compile time. The following table
shows how to change the number for each socket type.

| Socket Type     | Macro in `lwipopts.h`     | Notes                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| UDP             | `MEMP_NUM_UDP_PCB`        |                       |
| TCP             | `MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB`        | Simultaneously active |
| TCP (listening) | `MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB_LISTEN` | Listening             |

## UDP receive buffering

If UDP packets come in at a faster rate than they are consumed, some may get
dropped. To help mitigate this, the `EthernetUDP(queueSize)` constructor can be
called with a size > 1. The minimum size is 1, meaning any new packets will
cause any existing packet to get dropped. If it's set to 2 then there will be
space for one additional packet for a total of 2 packets, and so on. Setting a
value of zero will use the default of 1.

## mDNS services

It's possible to register mDNS services. Some notes:
* Similar to `Ethernet`, there is a global `MDNS` object. It too is in the
  `qindesign::network` namespace.
* It's possible to add TXT items when adding a service. For example, the
  following code adds "path=/" to the TXT of an HTTP service:
  ```c++
    MDNS.begin("Device Name");
    MDNS.addService("_http", "_tcp", 80, []() {
      return std::vector<String>{"path=/"};
    });
  ```
  You can add more than one item to the TXT record by adding to the vector.
* When adding a service, the function that returns TXT items defaults to NULL,
  so it's not necessary to specify that parameter. For example:
  ```c++
    MDNS.begin("Device Name");
    MDNS.addService("_http", "_tcp", 80);
  ```
* The host name is normally used as the service name, but there are also
  functions that let you specify the service name. For example:
  ```c++
  MDNS.begin("Host Name");
  MDNS.addService("my-http-service", "_http", "_tcp", 80);
  ```

## DNS

The library interfaces with DNS using the `DNSClient` class. Note that all the
functions are static.

Things you can do:
1. Look up an IP address by name, and
2. Set multiple DNS servers.

The `Ethernet.setDNSServerIP(ip)` function sets the zeroth DNS server address
and the `Ethernet.setDNSServerIP(index, ip)` function sets the nth DNS server
address. Corresponding `dnsServerIP()` functions get the DNS server addresses.

## stdio

Internally, lwIP uses `printf` for debug output and assertions. _QNEthernet_
defines its own `_write()` function so that it has more control over `stdout`
and `stderr` than that provided by the internal output support.

Note: As of Teensyduino 1.58-beta4, there's internal support for `printf`,
partially obviating the need for _QNEthernet_ to define its own. However, it
always maps all of `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` specifically to `Serial`.

Compared to the internal `printf` support, the _QNEthernet_ version:
1. Can map output to any `Print` interface, not just `Serial`,
2. Can separate `stdout` and `stderr` outputs, and
3. Disallows `stdin` as a valid output.

To enable the _QNEthernet_ version, define the `QNETHERNET_ENABLE_CUSTOM_WRITE`
macro and set the `stdoutPrint` or `stderrPrint` variables to point to a valid
`Print` implementation. Note that if the feature is disabled, then neither
`stdoutPrint` nor `stderrPrint` will be defined.

Both variables default to NULL.

For example:
```c++
// Define QNETHERNET_ENABLE_CUSTOM_WRITE somewhere

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial && millis() < 4000) {
    // Wait for Serial
  }
  qindesign::network::stdoutPrint = &Serial;
}
```

If your application wants to define its own `_write()` implementation or to use
the system default, then leave the `QNETHERNET_ENABLE_CUSTOM_WRITE`
macro undefined.

### Adapt stdio files to the Print interface

There is a utility class for decorating stdio `FILE*` objects with the `Print`
interface. See the `StdioPrint` class in _src/util/PrintUtils.h_.

This is useful when:
1. A `FILE*` object does its own buffering and you also need to write to the
   underlying `Print` object directly, `Serial` for example. It avoids having to
   remember to call `fflush()` on the `FILE*` before writing to the underlying
   `Print` object.
2. There's a need to easily print `Printable` objects to the `FILE*`.

## Raw Ethernet frames

There is support for sending and receiving raw Ethernet frames. See the
[`EthernetFrame`](#ethernetframe) API, above.

This API doesn't receive any known Ethernet frame types. These include:
1. IPv4 (0x0800)
2. ARP  (0x0806)
3. IPv6 (0x86DD) (if enabled)

If frames are addressed to a MAC address that doesn't belong to the device and
isn't a multicast group MAC address then it is necessary to tell the Ethernet
stack about it. See the `Ethernet.setMACAddressAllowed(mac, flag)` function.

An example that uses such MAC addresses is the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
over Ethernet. It uses 01-1B-19-00-00-00 for forwardable frames and
01-80-C2-00-00-0E for non-forwardable frames. See
[PTP Message Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol#Message_transport)

To enable raw frame support, define the `QNETHERNET_ENABLE_RAW_FRAME_SUPPORT`
macro. This will use some space.

### Promiscuous mode

It's possible to enable promiscuous mode so that all frames are received, even
ones whose destination MAC address would normally be filtered out by the
Ethernet hardware. To do this, define the `QNETHERNET_ENABLE_PROMISCUOUS_MODE`
macro.

### Raw frame receive buffering

Similar to [UDP buffering](#udp-receive-buffering), if raw frames come in at a
faster rate than they are consumed, some may get dropped. To help mitigate this,
the receive queue size can be adjusted with the
`EthernetFrame.setReceiveQueueSize(size)` function. The default queue size is 1
and the minimum size is also 1 (if a zero is passed in then 1 will be used
instead).

For a size of 1, any new frames will cause any existing frame to get dropped. If
the size is 2 then there will be space for one additional frame for a total of 2
frames, and so on.

## How to implement VLAN tagging

The lwIP stack supports VLAN tagging. Here are the steps for how to implement
it. Note that all defines should go inside `lwipopts.h`. Documentation for these
defines can be found in _src/lwip/opt.h_.

1. Define `ETHARP_SUPPORT_VLAN` as `1`.
2. To set VLAN tags, define `LWIP_HOOK_VLAN_SET`.
3. To validate VLAN tags on input, define one of:
   1. `LWIP_HOOK_VLAN_CHECK`, (see `LWIP_HOOK_VLAN_CHECK`)
   2. `ETHARP_VLAN_CHECK_FN`, (see `ETHARP_SUPPORT_VLAN`)
   3. `ETHARP_VLAN_CHECK`. (see `ETHARP_SUPPORT_VLAN`)

## Application layered TCP: TLS, proxies, etc.

lwIP provides a way to decorate the TCP layer. It's called "Application Layered
TCP." It enables an application to add things like TLS and proxies without
changing the source code.

Here are the steps to add decorated TCP:
1. Set `LWIP_ALTCP` and optionally `LWIP_ALTCP_TLS` to `1` in `lwipopts.h`.
2. Implement two functions somewhere in your code, having these names and
   signatures:
   ```c++
   std::function<bool(const ip_addr_t *ipaddr, uint16_t port,
                      altcp_allocator_t &allocator)> qnethernet_altcp_get_allocator;
   std::function<void(const altcp_allocator_t &allocator)> qnethernet_altcp_free_allocator;
   ```
3. Implement all the functions necessary for the wrapping implementation. For
   example, for TLS, this means all the functions declared in
   _src/lwip/altcp_tls.h_.

See _src/lwip/altcp.c_ and the _AltcpTemplate_ example for more information.

### About the allocator functions

The functions from step 2 create and destroy any resources used by the altcp
wrapper. The first function fills in the allocator function (`allocator->alloc`)
and an argument appropriate to that allocator function (`allocator->arg`). For
example, the `altcp_tcp_alloc()` allocator function doesn't need an argument (it
can be set to NULL), but `altcp_tls_alloc()` needs a pointer to a
`struct altcp_tls_config`.

The connection will fail if the allocator function is set to NULL.

The second function frees any resources that haven't already been freed. It's up
to the application and TCP wrapper implementation to properly manage resources
and to provide a way to determine whether a resource needs to be freed. It is
only called if `qnethernet_altcp_get_allocator` returns `true` and a socket
could not be created.

The `ipaddr` and `port` parameters indicate what the calling code is trying
to do:

1. If `ipaddr` is NULL then the application is trying to listen.
2. If `ipaddr` is not NULL then the application is trying to connect.

### About the TLS adapter functions

The _src/altcp_tls_adapter.cpp_ file implements the allocator functions for
altcp TLS integration. It specifies new functions that make it a little easier
to integrate a library. These are as follows:

1. Type: `std::function<bool(const ip_addr_t *ip, uint16_t port)>`\
   Name: `qnethernet_altcp_is_tls`\
   Description: Determines if the connection should use TLS. The IP address will
                be NULL for a server connection.
2. Type: `std::function<void(const ip_addr_t &ipaddr, uint16_t port,
                             const uint8_t *&cert, size_t &cert_len)>`\
   Name: `qnethernet_altcp_tls_client_cert`\
   Note: All the arguments are references.\
   Description: Retrieves the certificate for a client connection. The values
                are initialized to NULL and zero, respectively, before this
                function is called. The IP address and port can be used to
                determine the certificate data, if needed.
3. Type: `std::function<uint8_t(uint16_t port)>`\
   Name: `qnethernet_altcp_tls_server_cert_count`\
   Description: Returns the certificate count for a server connection.
4. Type: `std::function<void(uint16_t port, uint8_t index,
                             const uint8_t *&privkey,      size_t &privkey_len,
                             const uint8_t *&privkey_pass, size_t &privkey_pass_len,
                             const uint8_t *&cert,         size_t &cert_len)>`\
   Name: `qnethernet_altcp_tls_server_cert`\
   Description: Retrieves the certificate and private key for a server
                connection. The values are initialized to NULL and zero before
                this function is called. It will be called for each server
                certificate, a total of N times, where N is the value returned
                by `qnethernet_altcp_tls_server_cert_count`. The `index`
                argument will be in the range zero to N-1. The port and
                certificate index can be used to determine the certificate data,
                if needed.

Currently, this file is only built if the `LWIP_ALTCP`, `LWIP_ALTCP_TLS`, and
`QNETHERNET_ALTCP_TLS_ADAPTER` macros are enabled by setting them to `1`.

### How to enable Mbed TLS

The lwIP distribution comes with a way to use the Mbed TLS library as an ALTCP
TLS layer. It currently only supports the 2.x.x versions; as of this writing,
the latest version is 2.28.6.

More detailed information are in the subsections below, but here is an outline
of how to use this feature:
1. Set the following macros to `1` in _lwipopts.h_:
   1. LWIP_ALTCP &mdash; Enables the ALTCP layer
   2. LWIP_ALTCP_TLS &mdash; Enables the TLS features of ALTCP
   3. LWIP_ALTCP_TLS_MBEDTLS &mdash; Enables the Mbed TLS code for ALTCP TLS
   4. QNETHERNET_ALTCP_TLS_ADAPTER &mdash; Enables the _altcp_tls_adapter_
      functions that help ease integration
2. Install the latest Mbed TLS v2.x.x.
3. Implement the functions required by _src/altcp_tls_adapter.cpp_. This file
   implements the above allocator functions and simplifies the integration.
4. Implement an entropy function for internal Mbed TLS use.

#### Installing the Mbed TLS library

Currently, there doesn't seem to be an Arduino-friendly version of this library.
So, first download or clone a snapshot of the latest 2.x.x version (current as
of this writing is 2.28.6): http://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls

See the `v2.28.6` or `mbedtls-2.28.6` tags for the 2.28.6 version, or the
`mbedtls-2.28` branch for the latest 2.28.x version. The `development` and
`master` branches currently point to version 3.5.x.

##### Mbed TLS library install for Arduino IDE

In your preferred "Libraries" folder, create a folder named _mbedtls_.
Underneath that, create a _src_ folder. Copy, recursively, all files from the
distribution as follows:
1. distro/library/* -> "Libraries"/mbedtls/src
2. distro/include/* -> "Libraries"/mbedtls/src

The "Libraries" folder can is the same thing as "Sketchbook location" in the
application's Preferences. There should be a _libraries/_ folder inside
that location.

Next, create an empty _mbedtls.h_ file inside _"Libraries"/mbedtls/src/_.

Next, create a _library.properties_ file inside _"Libraries"/mbedtls/_:
```properties
name=Mbed TLS
version=2.28.6
sentence=Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols.
paragraph=Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.
category=Communication
url=https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls
includes=mbedtls.h
```
(Ref: https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/library-specification/)

Last, modify the _mbedtls/src/mbedtls/config.h_ file by replacing it with the
contents of _examples/MbedTLSDemo/sample_mbedtls_config.h_. Note that Mbed TLS
uses a slightly different configuration mechanism than lwIP; it uses macro
presence rather than macro values.

For posterity, the following changes are the minimum possible set just to be
able to get the library to compile:
1. Define:
   1. MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY
   2. MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT &mdash; Requires `mbedtls_hardware_poll()`
      function implementation
2. Undefine:
   1. MBEDTLS_NET_C
   2. MBEDTLS_TIMING_C
   3. MBEDTLS_FS_IO
   4. MBEDTLS_PSA_ITS_FILE_C
   5. MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_STORAGE_C

There are also example configuration headers in Mbed TLS under _configs/_.

It's likely that, if you're using the Arduino IDE, you'll need to restart it
after installing the library.

##### Mbed TLS library install for PlatformIO

In your preferred "Libraries" folder, create a folder named _mbedtls_. Copy all
files, recursively, from the Mbed TLS distribution into that folder.

The "Libraries" folder is either PlatformIO's global libraries location or the
application's local _lib/_ folder.

Next, create a _library.json_ file inside _"Libraries"/mbedtls/_:
```json
{
  "name": "Mbed TLS",
  "version": "2.28.6",
  "description": "Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.",
  "keywords": [
    "tls", "networking"
  ],
  "homepage": "https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls.git"
  },
  "license": "Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later",
  "build": {
    "srcDir": "library",
    "includeDir": "include"
  }
}
```
(Ref: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/manifests/library-json/index.html)

Last, modify the _mbedtls/include/mbedtls/config.h_ file per the instructions in
the previous, Arduino IDE install, section.

#### Implementing the _altcp_tls_adapter_ functions

The _MbedTLSDemo_ example illustrates how to implement these.

#### Implementing the Mbed TLS entropy function

See how the _MbedTLSDemo_ example does it. Look for the
`mbedtls_hardware_poll()` function. The example uses _QNEthernet_'s internal
entropy function, `trng_data()`. You can, of course, use your own entropy source
if you like.

If you add the function to a C++ file, then it must be declared `extern "C"`.

## On connections that hang around after cable disconnect

Ref: [EthernetServer accept no longer connects clients after unplugging/plugging ethernet cable ~7 times · Issue #15 · ssilverman/QNEthernet](https://github.com/ssilverman/QNEthernet/issues/15)

TCP tries its best to maintain reliable communication between two endpoints,
even when the physical link is unreliable. It uses techniques such as timeouts,
retries, and exponential backoff. For example, if a cable is disconnected and
then reconnected, there may be some packet loss during the disconnect time, so
TCP will try to resend any lost packets by retrying at successively larger
intervals.

The TCP close process uses some two-way communication to properly shut down a
connection, and therefore is also subject to physical link reliability. If the
physical link is interrupted or the other side doesn't participate in the close
process then the connection may appear to become "stuck", even when told to
close. The TCP stack won't consider the connection closed until all timeouts and
retries have elapsed.

It turns out that some systems drop and forget a connection when the physical
link is disconnected. This means that the other side may still be waiting to
continue or close the connection, timing out and retrying until all attempts
have failed. This can be as long as a half hour, or maybe more, depending on how
the stack is configured.

The above link contains a discussion where a user of this library couldn't
accept any new connections, even when all the connections had been closed, until
all the existing connections timed out after about a half hour. What happened
was this: connections were being made, the Ethernet cable was disconnected and
reconnected, and then more connections were made. When the cable was
disconnected, all connections were closed using the `close()` function. The
Teensy side still maintained connection state for all the connections, choosing
to do what TCP does: make a best effort to maintain or properly close those
connections. Once all the available sockets had been exhausted, no more
connections could be accepted.

Those connections couldn't be cleared and sockets made available until all the
TCP retries had elapsed. The main problem was that the other side simply dropped
the connections when it detected a link disconnect. If the other system had
maintained those connections, it would have continued the close processes as
normal when the Ethernet cable was reconnected. That's why tests on my system
couldn't reproduce the issue: the IP stack on the Mac maintained state across
cable disconnects/reconnects. The issue reporter was using Windows, and the IP
stack there apparently drops a connection if the link disconnects. This left the
Teensy side waiting for replies and retrying, and the Windows side no longer
sending traffic.

To mitigate this problem, there are a few possible solutions, including:
1. Reduce the number of retransmission attempts by changing the `TCP_MAXRTX`
   setting in `lwipopts.h`, or
2. Abort connections upon link disconnect.

To accomplish #2, there's an `EthernetClient::abort()` function that simply
drops a TCP connection without going though the normal TCP close process. This
could be called on connections when the link has been disconnected. (See also
`Ethernet.onLinkState(cb)` or `Ethernet.linkState()`.)

Fun links:
* [Removing Exponential Backoff from TCP | acm sigcomm](http://www.sigcomm.org/node/2736)
* [Exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)

## Notes on ordering and timing

* Link status is polled about 8 times a second.
* For static IP addresses, the _address-changed_ callback is called before
  lwIP's `netif_default` is set. `MDNS.begin()` relies on `netif_default`, so
  that function and anything else that relies on `netif_default` should be
  called after `Ethernet.begin(...)`, and not from the listener.
* The DNS lookup timeout is `DNS_MAX_RETRIES * DNS_TMR_INTERVAL`, where
  `DNS_TMR_INTERVAL` is 1000.

## Notes on RAM1 usage

By default, the Ethernet RX and TX buffers will go into RAM2. If, for whatever
reason, you'd prefer to put them into RAM1, define the
`QNETHERNET_BUFFERS_IN_RAM1` macro. _[As of this writing, no speed comparison
tests have been done.]_

There's a second configuration macro, `QNETHERNET_LWIP_MEMORY_IN_RAM1`, for
indicating that lwIP-declared memory should go into RAM1 instead of RAM2.

These options are useful in the case where a program needs more dynamic memory,
say. Putting more things in RAM1 will free up more space for things like `new`
and STL allocation.

## Heap memory use

The library is configured, by default, to use the system-defined malloc
functions. These include _malloc_, _free_, and _calloc_. The `MEM_LIBC_MALLOC`
option controls this. Setting `MEM_LIBC_MALLOC` to zero will change any internal
malloc calls to use the lwIP-supplied malloc functions with a preallocated heap.

When `MEM_LIBC_MALLOC` is enabled, the `MEM_SIZE` option is not used, and when
disabled, `MEM_SIZE` _is_ used and the heap is preallocated. One of the reasons
this option was enabled by default is that it saves memory if the whole heap
isn't used. Plus, it saves some program memory because it doesn't need to
include the code for the lwIP-defined functions. However, there's no cap on the
amount of memory a program can use which may be a concern for some software.

A second reason this option was enabled is that the current system-supplied
functions are likely optimized for the current platform. Yet a third reason is
it's hard to anticipate what programs will actually need; this way obviates the
need to assume what a good heap size is.

There's a few macros that can be used if you want to use your own malloc
functions and override the defaults. These are: `mem_clib_free`,
`mem_clib_malloc`, and `mem_clib_calloc`. By default, if not set, these point to
the system-provided functions.

For example, if you want to use EXTMEM for the heap, then you can define these
as `extmem_free`, `extmem_malloc`, and `extmem_calloc`, respectively. This could
either be done in _lwipopts.h_ or wherever your build system provides
build flags.

Example that defines these in _lwipopts.h_:

```c++
#define mem_clib_free extmem_free
#define mem_clib_malloc extmem_malloc
#define mem_clib_calloc extmem_calloc
```

## Entropy generation

This library defines functions for accessing the processor's internal "true
random number generator" (TRNG) for entropy. If your project needs to use the
_Entropy_ library instead, define the `QNETHERNET_USE_ENTROPY_LIB` macro so that
any internal entropy collection doesn't interfere with your project's
entropy collection.

The _Entropy_ library does the essentially same things as the internal TRNG
functions, it just requires an additional dependency. This is the reason these
functions are provided: to remove that dependency.

See the function declarations in _src/security/entropy.h_ if you want to use
them yourself.

### The `RandomDevice` _UniformRandomBitGenerator_

Also provided is a class called `RandomDevice` that implements the
[_UniformRandomBitGenerator_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/UniformRandomBitGenerator)
C++ named requirement. It's in the `qindesign::security` namespace. An instance
can be accessed by calling its `instance()` static function.

This object works with both the internal entropy functions and with the
_Entropy_ library.

## Configuration macros

There are several macros that can be defined to configure the system:

| Macro                                       | Description                                                     | Link                                                                                    |

See
[Changing lwIP configuration macros in `lwipopts.h`](#changing-lwip-configuration-macros-in-lwipoptsh)
for changing the IP stack configuration.

Note that disabling features means that the build will not include those
features, thus saving space.

### Configuring macros using the Arduino IDE

_[Current as of this writing: Arduino IDE 2.2.1, Teensyduino 1.58]_

The Arduino IDE provides a facility to override the build options specified in a
platform's build configuration file, _platform.txt_. It does this by looking for
a file named _platform.local.txt_ in the same place. Any options in that "local"
file override equivalent options in the main file.

Note that the IDE might need to be restarted when the file changes.

The suggested way to override compiler options is with the `*.extra_flags`
properties, for example, `compiler.cpp.extra_flags`, `compiler.c.extra_flags`,
and `build.extra_flags`. However, this only works if _platform.txt_ uses those
options. If it does not then there's nothing to override. The current
Teensyduino installation's _platform.txt_ file does not use these options.

Here's how to implement the behaviour:
1. Insert these sections somewhere in _platform.txt_, before the first location
   where these properties will be used:
   ```
   # This can be overridden in boards.txt
   build.extra_flags=

   # These can be overridden in platform.local.txt
   compiler.c.extra_flags=
   compiler.cpp.extra_flags=
   compiler.S.extra_flags=
   ```
2. Insert `{compiler.cpp.extra_flags}` and `{build.extra_flags}` before
   `{includes}` in:
   1. `recipe.preproc.includes`
   2. `recipe.preproc.macros`
   3. `recipe.cpp.o.pattern`
3. Insert `{compiler.c.extra_flags}` and `{build.extra_flags}` before
   `{includes}` in:
   1. `recipe.c.o.pattern`
4. Insert `{compiler.S.extra_flags}` and `{build.extra_flags}` before
   `{includes}` in:
   1. `recipe.S.o.pattern`

Next, create a _platform.local.txt_ file in the same directory as the
_platform.txt_ file and add the options you need. The contents of the properties
are exactly the same as if adding them to the command line. For example, to
enable raw frame support and disable DNS using the macros (the '-D' option
defines a macro):

```
compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DQNETHERNET_ENABLE_RAW_FRAME_SUPPORT -DLWIP_DNS=0
compiler.c.extra_flags=-DQNETHERNET_ENABLE_RAW_FRAME_SUPPORT -DLWIP_DNS=0
```

Each additional option is simply appended. No commas or quotes are required
unless they would be used for those same options on the command line.
See
[this issue comment](https://github.com/ssilverman/QNEthernet/issues/54#issuecomment-1788100978)
for some incorrect variants.

Note that both properties are needed because _QNEthernet_ contains a mixture of
C and C++ sources.

The properties of most interest are probably the ones in this example. There are
other ones defined in the Arduino AVR version, but aren't really needed here.

Lest you think I've forgotten to add it, here're the locations of the files for
the current latest version of the IDE:
* Mac: _~/Library/Arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr_
* Linux: _~/.arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr_
* Windows: _%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\teensy\hardware\avr_

### Configuring macros using PlatformIO

Simply add compiler flags to the `build_flags` build option in _platformio.ini_.

For example:

```
build_flags = -DQNETHERNET_ENABLE_RAW_FRAME_SUPPORT
```

### Changing lwIP configuration macros in `lwipopts.h`

The `lwipopts.h` file defines certain macros needed by the system. It is
appropriate for the user to alter some of those macros if needed, for example,
to change the number of UDP sockets or IGMP groups.

These macros can either be modified directly in the file (`lwipopts.h`) or from
the command line with a `-D` directive. The ones that can be modified from the
command line are either wrapped in an `#ifndef` block or not defined at all.

Useful macro list; please see further descriptions in `opt.h` and
in `mdns_opts.h`:

| Macro                     | Description                                                |

| `LWIP_UDP`                | Zero to disable UDP; also disables DHCP and DNS by default |
| `MEM_LIBC_MALLOC`         | Zero to enable use of lwIP-defined malloc functions        |
| `MEM_SIZE`                | Heap memory size; unused if `MEM_LIBC_MALLOC` is enabled   |
| `MEMP_NUM_IGMP_GROUP`     | Number of multicast groups                                 |

| `MDNS_MAX_SERVICES`       | Maximum number of mDNS services                            |

Some extra conditions to keep in mind:
* `MEMP_NUM_IGMP_GROUP`: Count must include 1 for the "all systems" group and 1
  if mDNS is enabled.
* `MEMP_NUM_UDP_PCB`: Count must include one if mDNS is enabled.

## Complete list of features

This section is an attempt to provide a complete list of features in the
_QNEthernet_ library.

1. Mostly compatible with the Arduino Ethernet API
2. [Additional functions and features not in the Arduino API](#additional-functions-and-features-not-in-the-arduino-api)
3. Automatic MAC address detection; it's not necessary to initialize the library
   with your own MAC address
4. A [DNS client](#dnsclient)
5. [mDNS](#mdns) support
6. [Raw Ethernet frame](#raw-ethernet-frames) support
7. [`stdio`](#stdio) output support for `stdout` and `stderr` &mdash;
   implemented to support lwIP's `printf()` calls, but user code can use this
   too
8. [VLAN tagging](#how-to-implement-vlan-tagging) support
9. [Zero-length UDP packets](#parsepacket-return-values)
10. [UDP](#udp-receive-buffering) and [raw frame](#raw-frame-receive-buffering)
    receive buffering
11. [Listeners](#how-to-use-listeners) to watch link, network interface, and
    address state
12. With some additions:
    1. IPv6
    2. IEEE 1588, Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
    3. TLS and TCP proxies
    4. IEEE 802.3az, Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
    5. Secure TCP initial sequence numbers (ISNs)
13. [Client shutdown options](#ethernetclient): _close_ (start close process
    without waiting), _closeOutput_ (close just the output side, also called a
    "half-close"), _abort_ (shuts down the connection without going through the
    TCP close process), _stop_ (close and wait)
14. Ability to [fully write](#how-to-write-data-to-connections) data to a
    client connection
15. [Multicast](#how-to-use-multicast) support
16. [Promiscuous mode](#promiscuous-mode)
17. `SO_REUSEADDR` support (see [`EthernetServer`](#ethernetserver)
    and [`EthernetUDP`](#ethernetudp))
18. [`TCP_NODELAY`](#tcp-socket-options) support
19. Configuration via [Configuration macros](#configuration-macros)
20. UDP and raw frame queueing for when data arrives in bursts that are faster
    than the ability of the program to process them
21. Non-blocking TCP connections
22. Internal [Entropy generation](#entropy-generation) functions to avoid the
    _Entropy_ lib dependency; this can be disabled with a configuration macro
23. A "random device" satisfying the _UniformRandomBitGenerator_ C++ named
    requirement that provides access to hardware-generated entropy (see
    [The `RandomDevice` _UniformRandomBitGenerator_](#the-randomdevice-uniformrandombitgenerator))

## Other notes

I'm not 100% percent certain where this library will go, but I want it to be
amazing. It's meant to be an alternative to the NativeEthernet/FNET library,
using a different underlying TCP/IP stack.

I'm also not settled on the name.

Input is welcome.

## To do

* Tune lwIP.
* A better API design than the Arduino-defined API.
* Perhaps zero-copy is an option.
* More unit tests.
* I have seen
  `Assertion "tcp_slowtmr: TIME-WAIT pcb->state == TIME-WAIT" failed at line 1442 in src/lwip/tcp.c`
  when sending a large amount of data. Either it's an lwIP bug or I'm doing
  something wrong.
  See: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lwip-users/2010-02/msg00013.html
* More examples.
* Fix reduced frame reception when Ethernet is restarted via
  `end()`/`begin(...)`. This is a vexing one.
